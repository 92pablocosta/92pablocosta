Hey There!
I'm Pablo, a Brazilian guy just changin carreers from being a chef to delevop new softwares and programs.
Cool right?
I'm currently back to Brazil after 4 years in Australia (how's it going mate?) and preparing myself
to get a job (remote or not) outside the country again. You can find everything that I'm working on
right here on my GitHub page! Take a look, maybe you'll find something you'll like :-)

My current skills include:

Python - Java - html - css

I know, not impressive but I'm working on that!

If you need to reach me for any reason (but specially to give me a job lol) you can find my social media on the left side of this profile.
Come and say hi!
